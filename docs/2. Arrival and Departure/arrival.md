# Arrival

When arriving at our house, you will have gotten a unique code for the main door of the house, that has a smart lock.
The code is created for your arrival and will be deleted after you have left, but still, it's important to keep the
code safe, as anyone with the code can gain entry to the house. To make your stay easier, you can also choose to use
the rfid-chip that you'll find inside the house. It's very simple to use, as detailed below.

## Entry

### Code

Using the keypad, enter the 6-digit code enclosed by a star at the beginning and end.
For example:
> \* 123456 \*

### Chip
Above the keypad, theres an indented symbol - hold the chip by this symbol and the door should open.

### Locking the door
From the outside, you lock the door by hitting the `*` symbol.
From the inside, turn the lock 45 degrees towards where the bolt should go, then let go. There's an LED that 
will light up red if the door got locked. If you hear an error noise, try to make sure the door is properly shut.
