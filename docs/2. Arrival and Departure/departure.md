# Departure

When you are about to leave us, please make sure of the following:
- Empty the garbage cans in the house, info on this [here](<../7.%20Household%20Supplies/recycling_and_garbage.md>)
- Make sure the doors to the garden and all door-windows as well as doors are closed and locked

:::tip How was your stay?
We'd love to learn how to get better, and get honest feedback. The best way for you to do that after your stay
is by leaving a review from the email you'll get from AirBnB or by logging in to AirBnB and checking your profile.
Anything missing from this online guide? You can also let us know about that [directly](../11.%20Contact%20information/contact.md)
