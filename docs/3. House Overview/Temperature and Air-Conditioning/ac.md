# Air-Conditioning

This is our main way of controlling the temperature in the house. Use the remote, set a temperature, and switch different modes.
Personally we find the `Auto` mode to not work sufficiently, so we instead switch between `Cool` (the ice cube icon) and `Heat` (the sun icon) modes depending on our needs.
