# Heating

Every room with tiles has heating in the floor. This is controlled by the thermostat on the wall, which you can set to a desired temperature.
These should be set to a cozy temperature already so there is no need to change them, as long as everything works as expected.

Besides that and the [air-conditioning](./ac.md), there is no other heating in the house except the fireplace, which can be used during the winter months to create a cozy atmosphere (and raise the temperature, of course!).
