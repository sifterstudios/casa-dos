# Kitchen

The kitchen isn't really something super fancy, so we're confident you'll find out
how the appliances work pretty quickly. Here are some useful tips, though:

---

- The vent turns on and adjusts automatically, you don't need to do anything!
- There's a `Stove guard` right under the vent (white rectangular thing), that will start an alarm if it senses too high
  of a temperature by the cooktop. If you're cooking, touch the only button on the unit to let it now you are there. If
  you don't do anything once the alarm starts, the cooktop will turn itself off, and you will have to touch the button
  on the unit to get the electricity back again.
