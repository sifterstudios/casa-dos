# Robots

At present, we have two robots in the house; a robot-lawnmower and a robot-vacuumer. Both are set to do their thing
automatically, but you can circumvent this quite easily if that doesn't fit with your schedule. More info below:

## Robot Lawnmower

The lawnmower is set cut grass throughout the day, as long as it's not raining. If it gets stuck, we would
appreciate it if you could move it back onto the grass, hit the STOP button so the lid can be opened, and then
input the code `1990` so that it can start again.

Robot vacuumer
Our vacuumer, aptly named Dusty, usually starts its round of cleaning at around noon. If that doesn't fit or isn't
necessary, push the üè† icon on it to make it return to its charging station. If you don't want it to do anything at all,
it's possible to turn it off entirely with an on-off switch on the side of the device, however, we ask nicely that you
turn it on again before you leave sea-casa!
