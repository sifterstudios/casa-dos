# Friendly Rules

We have some simple rules that we want tenants to abide by, detailed below:

- There are some rooms that are marked with "Private" on them. These are used for storage while we rent out and aren't
  meant to be used by tenants during their stay.
- Doors need to be shut and locked when tenants leave the house, that goes for side-doors as well. To close the doors
  without smart locks, turn the door handle upwards; then you can turn the lock. When the door is locked, you cannot
  turn the door handle down (as you would when opening the door).
