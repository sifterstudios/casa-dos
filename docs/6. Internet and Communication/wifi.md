# Wi-fi

There's a QR-code by the entrance or on the dining table that will get you connected, and SSID and password for our wifi
is also there. We have pretty good coverage in the whole house, but it's better in the first two floors than in the top
floor. Also, our internet has 1 Gbit upload and download speed, so you will be able to use it without any speed
issues.
