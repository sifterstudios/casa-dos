# Cleaning and Laundry

If you've spilled something and need to clean it up, what you need will be in the laundry room.

You're free to use the washing machine and/or tumbler, they're pretty straightforward to operate.

For the tumbler, we turn the switch on step to the right, and then turn it on. After use, empty the water container and
clean out the filter!
